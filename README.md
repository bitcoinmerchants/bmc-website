## Criteria for bitcoin POS solutions to be included on the BMC website

The BMC seeks to include a variety of point-of-sale solutions that allow merchants to accept bitcoin payments irrespective of which system they currently use or where they may be located. The solution should demonstrate evidence of adoption, ease of use, and/or other unique value propositions.

If you're a Bitcoin POS software vendor, please [contract the BMC](mailto:bitcoinmerchants@spiral.xyz) and describe how your solution meets the following inclusion criteria: 

**1. Targets bitcoin payment acceptance in the in-person retail use case**
 - Provide evidence of in-person retail merchant adoption.
 - Provide a reference/quote from at least one physical retail merchant using it.

**2. Ease of set-up**
 - Explain the specific steps a merchant would need to follow to get up and running with your bitcoin POS solution. Please provide screenshots, links to product documentation, video tutorials, or other material that would help understand the getting-started UX.

**3. Ease of use**
 - Describe the UX for a customer making a bitcoin payment with your solution at a merchant. Again, please provide screenshots or documentation that helps illustrate the customer experience.

**4. Any other unique value proposition?**
 - Is there anything else about your solution that would qualify it as particularly notable for merchant awareness? 

**5. Assets**
 - Provide a one-line description of your POS solution in accurate, neutral language. See the [existing website](https://www.bitcoinmerchantcommunity.org/) for examples.
 - Provide a high-resolution logo in PNG format.
