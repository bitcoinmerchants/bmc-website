                                You can accept bitcoin payments by offering customers a QR code invoice at checkout that they can scan to pay you from their bitcoin wallet instantly. It's as simple as paying with a credit card—only on their phone.

                                On other systems, they generally range from 0.4% to 1%, but you will need to consult your software vendor for specifics. The big takeaway, though, is that bitcoin payment fees will never be as high as credit card fees.

                                Bitcoin's price relative to the US dollar, also known as its conversation rate, fluctuates often. Sometimes wildly. Whether you hold your bitcoin or convert it to local currency upon receiving a payment is ultimately your decision, as it should be.

                                To limit exposure to bitcoin's volatility, you can enable auto-conversions on your Square hardware you use to accept bitcoin payment. This will let you capture bitcoin's foremost merchant benefit, avoiding 3% credit card fees, without exposure to short-term volatility.

                                For bitcoin point-of-sale systems that support tipping, the tip amount (or percentage) will usually be defined by the customer before you generate a QR code invoice. The customer then pays the invoice in bitcoin for the purchase amount + tip, which you will receive instantly.

                                Some POS solutions allow tips to be segregated by user account, others gather tips into one lump sum.

                                Alongside physical cash, bitcoin spenders will already view digital cash as the fairest way for merchants to get paid. Many will pay in bitcoin to do the right thing by you and by bitcoin's growth as the best form of everyday money.
